#(Computer Experiment.)

Get the data on eruption times and waiting times between eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser from the website. Estimate the mean waiting time and give a standard error for the estimate. Also, give a 90 percent conﬁdence interval for the mean waiting time. Now estimate the median waiting time. In the next chapter we will see how to get the standard error for the median.
